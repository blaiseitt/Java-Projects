# TestingWithSelenium
This repository contains 2 diffrent applications.
SelleniumTesting and SelleniumTestingWithMockito are the same application, the only diffrence is the way that tests(JUnit, Mockito)
were conducted. This applications checks if all links on the site are valid.

TemperatureConverter is just a .html page which allows converting Celsius into Kelvin and Fahrenheit. The main concern of this 
excercise were tests which were conducted using Sellenium in contrast to previous app in which Sellenium was used in order to make app working :)
